# Pneumonia Detection
Pneumonia Detection using Transfer Learning (ResNet50)

Pneumonia is a life-threatening disease, especially for children and the elderly. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. In this research, we present a deep learning model for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. We used a publicly available dataset of 5,863 chest X-ray images (JPEG) with two categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Our model achieved an accuracy of 98%, demonstrating its potential for accurate and efficient pneumonia diagnosis. This research contributes to the development of a reliable and cost-effective diagnostic tool for pneumonia, which has significant implications for patient care and public health.
